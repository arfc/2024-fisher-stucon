	abstract = {This paper proposes two contributions to the literature on the social acceptance ({SA}) of energy systems and public perceptions of renewable energy ({RE}) transitions. The first contribution is methodological, recognizing more effective and inclusive forms of engagement begin with building reciprocal relationships and collaborative research partnerships operationalizing the tenets of energy justice. Employing these methodological recommendations, we conducted a collaborative, inclusive, and equitable research design and engagement practice by collaborating with Tribal members on research with expressly mutual benefits. In this work, a years-long collaboration of Tribal members and non-Tribal researchers developed a methodology to survey respondents at an accessible and culturally relevant community event to learn about preferences and perceived barriers to transitioning to {RE}. A second contribution is empirical. The results suggest shared priorities for energy solutions that enhance energy sovereignty, i.e., community control and ownership of energy services provisioning. They also demonstrate widespread awareness regarding barriers to a {RE} transition and simultaneously, some potential misperceptions about the challenges to transition. This study reinforces the need for {SA} research to move beyond asking what technologies receive public support and where those technologies should be sited to consider how access and transparency in planning processes, collaboration, engagement, development, ownership, and benefits are organized and can be radically reconfigured to enable the just transition to a decarbonized energy system.},

This essay examines the participation process for nuclear waste siting decisions and suggests that the lack of a viable means for discussion of competing values is a flaw in the currently used model of participation. Through analysis of the Yucca Mountain high-level nuclear waste site in the {USA}, I show how the lack of discussion of values occludes participation by marginalized American Indians. In particular, I examine the incommensurability between American Indian nations that value Yucca Mountain as sacred land and the federal government that values Yucca Mountain as a national sacrifice zone. I argue that Yucca Mountain acts as a polysemous value term in the controversy. My findings suggest that an environmentally just model of participation in environmental decision making must include a way to account for incommensurable values and cultural differences. Further, I highlight the lessons we can learn from the Yucca Mountain project as we deliberate about what to do with nuclear waste.},

	abstract = {Regional water pollution and use of unregulated water sources can be an important mixed metals exposure pathway for rural populations located in areas with limited water infrastructure and an extensive mining history. Using censored data analysis and mapping techniques we analyzed the joint geospatial distribution of arsenic and uranium in unregulated water sources throughout the Navajo Nation, where over 500 abandoned uranium mine sites are located in the rural southwestern United States. Results indicated that arsenic and uranium concentrations exceeded national drinking water standards in 15.1 \% (arsenic) and 12.8 \% (uranium) of tested water sources. Unregulated sources in close proximity (i.e., within 6 km) to abandoned uranium mines yielded significantly higher concentrations of arsenic or uranium than more distant sources. The demonstrated regional trends for potential co-exposure to these chemicals have implications for public policy and future research. Specifically, to generate solutions that reduce human exposure to water pollution from unregulated sources in rural areas, the potential for co-exposure to arsenic and uranium requires expanded documentation and examination. Recommendations for prioritizing policy and research decisions related to the documentation of existing health exposures and risk reduction strategies are also provided.},

	abstract = {Energy security, energy poverty and energy sovereignty are all too frequently explored from separate perspectives. In this chapter, we explore the complex interlinkages between them, and tease out implications for contemporary energy analysis and policymaking. Energy poverty is framed in the literature as lack of access to electricity networks and dependence on solid fuels for cooking. We expand this definition by adding lack of access to energy services. Energy security is conceptualized as minimizing the vulnerability of vital energy systems and enabling the provision of energy services. Energy sovereignty is concerned with decision making and enabling people to follow certain energy use patterns. Furthermore, energy sovereignty emphasizes the role of local people and their institutions in determining their energy systems in ways that are culturally relevant and ecologically sustainable. In the first three sections of this chapter, we explore the three key overlapping concepts – energy poverty, energy security, and energy sovereignty – individually, and in the final section explain how they interact, and what this interaction means both for scholars interested in energy as well as for policymakers and planners seeking to address energy problems.},

Although extensive work has identified pathways towards a “just transition” in numerous contexts, very little has been written to understand the opportunities and challenges for fossil fuel-producing Native nations in a transition towards a net-zero emissions future. In theory, Native American nations have control over the decisions that shape their energy futures because of their sovereign status. In practice, however, numerous factors limit the exercise of that sovereignty. In this review, we assess the major barriers to tribal energy sovereignty, discuss historical and ongoing efforts to secure it, and highlight the tools that can further ensure the exercise of tribal energy sovereignty in the context of an energy transition. We also discuss recent policy developments and identify cases where Native nations are taking innovative approaches to govern the future of energy development on their lands.},

	abstract = {By many measures, Indian tribal members live at a significant disadvantage as compared to non-Indian citizens when it comes to poverty, food security, and prevalence of violent crime. One measure of disadvantage that is not frequently discussed is that many Indian tribal members living in Indian Country do not have ready access to electrical energy. Yet, the Department of Energy states that over 14 billion megawatt hours ({MWh}) of solar resources and 1.1 billion {MWh} of wind resources are available in Indian Country. The presence of such abundant renewable energy resources begs the question of why access to energy in Indian Country is so low. This is especially troublesome when considering that wind and solar energy resources can be developed as either utility-scale grid-connected facilities, or as small-scale geographically distributed facilities that service individual households. In essence, renewable energy sources are the ideal forms of energy to bring energy access to Indian Country. This Article explores how centuries of changing federal policy toward Indian tribal governments and tribal members have shaped the current state of energy access in Indian Country. Furthermore, this Article examines how economic incentives such as the Investment Tax Credit, the Production Tax Credit, feed-in tariffs, net metering, and state renewable portfolio standards have been successful at bringing renewable energy generation online, but actually steer renewable energy development away from Indian Country to the detriment of tribal governments, tribal members, energy developers, and energy consumers.},

	abstract = {Native Americans residing in a broad region downwind from the Nevada Test Site during the 1950s and 1960s received significant radiation exposures from nuclear weapons testing. Because of differences in diet, activities, and housing, their radiation exposures are only very imperfectly represented in the Department of Energy dose reconstructions. There are important missing pathways, including exposures to radioactive iodine from eating small game. The dose reconstruction model assumptions about cattle feeding practices across a year are unlikely to apply to the native communities as are other model assumptions about diet. Thus exposures from drinking milk and eating vegetables have not yet been properly estimated for these communities. Through consultations with members of the affected communities, these deficiencies could be corrected and the dose reconstruction extended to Native Americans. An illustration of the feasibility of extending the dose reconstruction is provided by a sample calculation to estimate radiation exposures to the thyroid from eating radio-iodine-contaminated rabbit thyroids after the Sedan test. The illustration is continued with a discussion of how the calculation results may be used to make estimates for other tests and other locations.},
